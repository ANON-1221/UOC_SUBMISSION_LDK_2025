For the purpose of this work, we use ordinal values for sentiment intensity i.e. weak$<$average$<$strong.\nan opinion. The value of sentiment intensity should never be N/A.\n2. **Sentiment Polarity**: It is a predefined semantic orientation of the sentiment expressed in an opinion. It takes on one of the three polarity values i.e. postive, negative or neutral. The sentiment polarity cannot be N/A.\n3. **Sentiment Expression**: The sentiment expression is the subjective statement (on an aspect) which indicates a presence of sentiment. It can be a word or a phrase explicitly present in the text. \n4. **Aspect Category**: Aspect Category of an entity represents a unique aspect of the entity. It expresses attributes or properties of the aforementioned entities.\n5. **Aspect Term**: It is an expression i.e. actual word or phrases in the text indicating an aspect category. Like sentiment expression it must be explicitly present in the input text.\n6. **Target Entity**: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. The opinion is expressed with opinion expressions on the opinion target which are implicitly an aspect (or attribute) of the entity. \n7. **Opinion Holder Span **: An opinion holder (also called opinion source) is a person or organization who expressed an opinion. It must be explictly present in the input text.\n7. **Opinion Holder Entity **: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event.

The input text is a description of a location. The text does not explicitly mention any positive or negative sentiment. However, the absence of a kitchen and the necessity to share a bathroom can be interpreted as negative aspects of the location.\n2. The sentiment intensity is strong because the absence of a kitchen and the necessity to share a bathroom are significant drawbacks.\n3. The opinion holder is the author of the text, but the author is not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, the opinion holder span is N/A.\n4. The opinion holder entity is the author, but the author is not explicitly mentioned in the text. Therefore, the opinion holder entity is N/A.\n5.
