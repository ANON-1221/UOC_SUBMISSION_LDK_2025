Follow the field descriptions and format guidelines to accurately capture the opinion information within the text.\n### Description of Opinion Fields:\n1. **Sentiment Intensity**: It expresses the strength of the identified sentiment in an opinion. For the purpose of this work, we use ordinal values for sentiment intensity i.e. weak$<$average$<$strong.\nan opinion. The value of sentiment intensity should never be N/A.\n2. **Sentiment Polarity**: It is a predefined semantic orientation of the sentiment expressed in an opinion. It takes on one of the three polarity values i.e. postive, negative or neutral. The sentiment polarity cannot be N/A.\n3. **Sentiment Expression**: The sentiment expression is the subjective statement (on an aspect) which indicates a presence of sentiment. It can be a word or a phrase explicitly present in the text. \n4. **Aspect Category**: Aspect Category of an entity represents a unique aspect of the entity. It expresses attributes or properties of the aforementioned entities.\n5. **Aspect Term**: It is an expression i.e. actual word or phrases in the text indicating an aspect category. Like sentiment expression it must be explicitly present in the input text.\n6. **Target Entity**: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. The opinion is expressed with opinion expressions on the opinion target which are implicitly an aspect (or attribute) of the entity. \n7. **Opinion Holder Span **: An opinion holder (also called opinion source) is a person or organization who expressed an opinion. It must be explictly present in the input text.\n7. **Opinion Holder Entity **: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. Holder entities are the entity that is expressing the opinion.\n8. **Opinion Qualifier**: A qualifier of an opinion limits or modifies the meaning of the opinion\n9. **Opinion Reason**: A reason for an opinion is the cause of the opinion.\n\n### Format Guidelines:\n1.

For the purpose of this work, we use ordinal values for sentiment intensity i.e. weak$<$average$<$strong.\nan opinion. The value of sentiment intensity should never be N/A.\n2. **Sentiment Polarity**: It is a predefined semantic orientation of the sentiment expressed in an opinion. It takes on one of the three polarity values i.e. postive, negative or neutral. The sentiment polarity cannot be N/A.\n3. **Sentiment Expression**: The sentiment expression is the subjective statement (on an aspect) which indicates a presence of sentiment. It can be a word or a phrase explicitly present in the text. \n4. **Aspect Category**: Aspect Category of an entity represents a unique aspect of the entity. It expresses attributes or properties of the aforementioned entities.\n5. **Aspect Term**: It is an expression i.e. actual word or phrases in the text indicating an aspect category. Like sentiment expression it must be explicitly present in the input text.\n6. **Target Entity**: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. The opinion is expressed with opinion expressions on the opinion target which are implicitly an aspect (or attribute) of the entity. \n7. **Opinion Holder Span **: An opinion holder (also called opinion source) is a person or organization who expressed an opinion. It must be explictly present in the input text.\n7. **Opinion Holder Entity **: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event.

For the purpose of this work, we use ordinal values for sentiment intensity i.e. weak$<$average$<$strong.\nan opinion. The value of sentiment intensity should never be N/A.\n2. **Sentiment Polarity**: It is a predefined semantic orientation of the sentiment expressed in an opinion.

The value of sentiment intensity should never be N/A.\n2. **Sentiment Polarity**: It is a predefined semantic orientation of the sentiment expressed in an opinion. It takes on one of the three polarity values i.e. postive, negative or neutral. The sentiment polarity cannot be N/A.\n3. **Sentiment Expression**: The sentiment expression is the subjective statement (on an aspect) which indicates a presence of sentiment. It can be a word or a phrase explicitly present in the text. \n4. **Aspect Category**: Aspect Category of an entity represents a unique aspect of the entity. It expresses attributes or properties of the aforementioned entities.\n5. **Aspect Term**: It is an expression i.e. actual word or phrases in the text indicating an aspect category. Like sentiment expression it must be explicitly present in the input text.\n6. **Target Entity**: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. The opinion is expressed with opinion expressions on the opinion target which are implicitly an aspect (or attribute) of the entity. \n7. **Opinion Holder Span **: An opinion holder (also called opinion source) is a person or organization who expressed an opinion. It must be explictly present in the input text.\n7. **Opinion Holder Entity **: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event.
