For the purpose of this work, we use ordinal values for sentiment intensity i.e. weak$<$average$<$strong.\nan opinion. The value of sentiment intensity should never be N/A.\n2. **Sentiment Polarity**: It is a predefined semantic orientation of the sentiment expressed in an opinion. It takes on one of the three polarity values i.e. postive, negative or neutral. The sentiment polarity cannot be N/A.\n3. **Sentiment Expression**: The sentiment expression is the subjective statement (on an aspect) which indicates a presence of sentiment. It can be a word or a phrase explicitly present in the text. \n4. **Aspect Category**: Aspect Category of an entity represents a unique aspect of the entity. It expresses attributes or properties of the aforementioned entities.\n5. **Aspect Term**: It is an expression i.e. actual word or phrases in the text indicating an aspect category. Like sentiment expression it must be explicitly present in the input text.\n6. **Target Entity**: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. The opinion is expressed with opinion expressions on the opinion target which are implicitly an aspect (or attribute) of the entity. \n7. **Opinion Holder Span **: An opinion holder (also called opinion source) is a person or organization who expressed an opinion. It must be explictly present in the input text.\n7. **Opinion Holder Entity **: An entity is a product, service, topic, issue, person, organization, or event. Holder entities are the entity that is expressing the opinion.\n8. **Opinion Qualifier**: A qualifier of an opinion limits or modifies the meaning of the opinion\n9. **Opinion Reason**: A reason for an opinion is the cause of the opinion.\n\n### Format Guidelines:\n1.

It is a unique aspect of the entity \"welfare system\".\n\n### Step 4: Identify the sentiment polarity and intensity\nThe sentiment polarity is \"negative\" and the sentiment intensity is \"strong\". The sentiment is negative because the text describes the welfare system as a \"sad tale\", indicating a negative opinion. The sentiment intensity is strong because the text uses the word \"sad\", which implies a strong negative emotion.\n\n### Step 5: Identify the opinion holder entity\nThe opinion holder entity is \"author\". It is the person or organization that expressed the opinion.\n\n### Step 6: Identify the opinion qualifier and reason\nThe opinion qualifier is \"N/A\" because there is no qualifier in the text that limits or modifies the meaning of the opinion. The opinion reason is \"N/A\" because there is no reason given in the text for the opinion.\n\nThe final answer is: \n- Opinion 1\n\t- aspect_term: welfare system\n\t- sentiment_expression: sad tale\n\t- target_entity: welfare system\n\t- aspect_category: operational_performance\n\t- sentiment_polarity: negative\n\t- sentiment_intensity: strong\n\t- opinion_holder_span: N/A\n\t- opinion_holder_entity: author\n\t- opinion_qualifier: N/A\n\t- opinion_reason: N/A\n\n### Step 7: Generate the final annotated output\nThe final annotated output is the list of opinions with their corresponding fields.\n\nThe final answer is: \n- Opinion 1\n\t- aspect_term: welfare system\n\t- sentiment_expression: sad tale\n\t- target_entity: welfare system\n\t- aspect_category: operational_performance\n\t- sentiment_polarity: negative\n\t- sentiment_intensity: strong\n"}, {"id": "b-19", "text": "And then we about hit rock bottom with The Demonwar Saga .", "res": "\n### Annotation Instructions:\nYou are tasked with annotating a provided text for various opinion components.
